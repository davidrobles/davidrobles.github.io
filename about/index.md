# About

Hi, I'm David Robles, I'm a Software Engineer who enjoys tackling engineering challenges and writing high-quality
software. I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at [Hearsay Social] (http://www.hearsaysocial.com/), in San
Francisco.

Before starting my career as a Software Engineer, I received a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Essex,
where I conducted research focused on Reinforcement Learning, Simulation-Based Search, Evolutionary Algorithms and
Games. During this time I was also a Teaching Assistant in several courses in programming and web application
development.
