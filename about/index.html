<h1>About</h1>

<p>I’m a Software Engineer from Hermosillo, Mexico, currently currently working at Hearsay Social. I
recently completed an MSc and PhD in Computer Science from the University of Essex, where I
conducted research focused on Reinforcement Learning, Simulation-Based Search, Evolutionary
Algorithms and Games. During this time I was also a Teaching Assistant in several courses in
programming and web application development.</p>

<p>In my free time, I love programming in Ruby, Rails, Python, and more recently I've been diving to
get into functional programming. I love sports, especially baseball, football and MMA. I’m kind of
addicted to both Fantasy Baseball and Football, so if you have a league please invite me.</p>
