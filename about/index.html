<p>Software Engineer with a strong focus on tackling engineering challenges, writing quality software
and with strong grasp of software architecture, advanced software engineering principles and design
patterns.</p>

<p>I recently completed an MSc and PhD in Computer Science from the University of Essex, where I
conducted research focused on Reinforcement Learning, Simulation-Based Search, Evolutionary
Algorithms and Games. During this time I was also a Teaching Assistant in several courses in
programming and web application development.</p>

<p>I'm currently a Software Engineer at dotloop, where I work primarily as a Java backend developer
responsible for designing and implementing new features and RESTful APIs. In my free time, I love
programming in Ruby, Rails, Python, and more recently I've been diving to get into functional
programming.</p>
