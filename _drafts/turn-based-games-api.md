We will define an API for turn-based players. This can be games of n-number of players, as long as
only one player can move per turn. A few examples of this games are
[Tic-Tac-Toe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe), Checkers, Chess, etc. 

Here we define a simple API that will allow us to play basically any game with a generic algorithm:

A player only needs to be a function such as:

- .move(game). It takes a game state and returns the move to take. If it returns a number, it will
  be assumed it is the index of the list of moves. If is a string, it is the string representation.

### Game

A game is a description of strategic interaction that includes the constraints on the actions that
the players can take and the playersâ€™ interests, but does not specify the actions that the players
do take (Rasmusen, 2006).

We can define the basic interface of a turn-based games as,

{% highlight python %}
class Game:

    def copy(self):
        """
        Returns a copy of the game.
        """
        pass

    def current_player(self):
        """
        Returns the player whose turn it is. (e.g. 1)
        """
        pass

    def is_over(self):
        """
        Returns true if the game is over, false otherwise.
        """
        pass

    def get_moves(self):
        """
        Returns the legal moves for the player in turn.
        """

    def move(self, move):
        """
        Makes a move for the player whose turn it is.
        """
        pass

    def new_game(self):
        """
        Returns a new game.
        """
        pass

    def num_moves(self):
        """
        Returns the number of legal moves for the player in turn.
        """
        pass

    def outcomes(self):
        """
        Returns a dictionary with the outcomes for each of the players.
        """
        pass

    def reset(self):
        """
        Restarts the game.
        """
        pass

{% endhighlight %}

Now let's put an example of what the implementation of Tic Tac Toe would return with the given API.

#### Copy

{% highlight python %}
tic = TicTacToe()
tic.move(5)
tic.move(4)
print tic
tic_copy = tic.copy()
print tic_copy
print id(tic)
print id(tic_copy)
{% endhighlight %}

#### Current player

{% highlight python %}
tic = TicTacToe()
print tic.current_player()
tic.move(1)
print tic.current_player()
tic.move(2)
print tic.current_player()
{% endhighlight %}

Note: Of course, the efficiency of the game is not the priority, because well, we wouldn't be using
Python in the first place. But for illustrative purposes I think Python is a great prototyping
programming language. All the examples presented here are 

### Players

Players are the individuals who make decisions. A player can be defined as a class that has a
*move()* method that takes that current state of the game and returns the move to take for the
player in turn.

{% highlight python %}
class Player:

    def move(self, game, time_due=0):
        return "Move 1"
{% endhighlight %}

As we can see, we also have an optional "timedue" argument that contains the time the player has to
computation.

For example, we can create a player that makes a random move,

{% highlight python %}
import random

class RandomPlayer:

    def move(self, game, time_due=0):
        return random.choice(game.get_moves())
{% endhighlight %}

Let's start a Tic-tac-toe game as an example:

{% highlight python %}
tic = TicTacToe()
print tic
#=> Player in turn: 1
#=> Legal moves: ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']
#=> - - -
#=> - - -
#=> - - -
{% endhighlight %}

We can use the random player to take a random move,

{% highlight python %}
rand_player = RandomPlayer()
move = rand_player.move(tic) # e.g. move = '4'
tic.move(move)
print tic
#=> Player in turn: 2
#=> Legal moves: ['1', '2', '3', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']
#=> - - -
#=> X - -
#=> - - -
{% endhighlight %}

This simple framework allows us 

### Match

The game interface that we previously defined represent the current state of the game, which is the
only thing needed to take a game. For simplicity, we will define a *match* class to play games until
the end.

{% highlight python %}
game = TicTacToe()
players = [RandomPlayer(), RandomPlayer()]
match = Match(game, players)
match.play()
print game

#=> Player 1 wins!
#=> O O X
#=> - X O
#=> X - X
{% endhighlight %}

We can pass the verbose option in the play() method,

{% highlight python %}
game = TicTacToe()
players = [RandomPlayer(), RandomPlayer()]
match = Match(game, players)
match.play(verbose=true)

#=> Player in turn: 1
#=> Legal moves: ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']
#=> - - -
#=> - - -
#=> - - -
#=>
#=> Player in turn: 2
#=> Legal moves: ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']
#=> X - -
#=> - - -
#=> - - -
#=>
#=> Player in turn: 1
#=> Legal moves: ['2', '3', '4', '6', '7', '8', '9']
#=> X - -
#=> - O -
#=> - - -
#=>
#=> Player in turn: 2
#=> Legal moves: ['2', '4', '6', '7', '8', '9']
#=> X - X
#=> - O -
#=> - - -
#=>
#=> Player in turn: 1
#=> Legal moves: ['2', '4', '7', '8', '9']
#=> X - X
#=> - O O
#=> - - -
#=>
#=> Player 1 wins!
#=> X X X
#=> - O O
#=> - - -
