excerpt:    "In this post I describe a simple API for abstract strategy games and algorithms to play these games. An
interface like this one is the base of a game-playing framework and it will be used in following blog posts
to describe algorithms such as Minimax, Alpha-Beta and Monte-Carlo Tree Search."

<p>
    D3.js is a fantastic JavaScript library for data visualization. In this post I'll present how to visualize
    a a game tree.
</p>

<p>
    I'll be using the same API for abstract strategy games defined in a <a href="http://www.google.com">previous post</a>.
    I'll be using the game of Tic-Tac-Toe,

<h2>What is a game tree?</h2>

<p>In game theory, a game tree is a directed graph whose nodes are positions in a game and whose edges are moves.</p>

<div id="here"></div>

<h2>Depth-first search</h2>

<p>
    Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. One starts at
    the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along
    each branch before backtracking.
</p>

<h2>Breadth-first search</h2>

<p>
    In graph theory, breadth-first search (BFS) is a strategy for searching in a graph when search is limited to
    essentially two operations: (a) visit and inspect a node of a graph; (b) gain access to visit the nodes that
    neighbor the currently visited node.
