excerpt:    "In this post I describe a simple API for abstract strategy games and algorithms to play these games. An
interface like this one is the base of a game-playing framework and it will be used in following blog posts
to describe algorithms such as Minimax, Alpha-Beta and Monte-Carlo Tree Search."

<p>
    D3.js is a fantastic JavaScript library for data visualization. In this post I'll present how to visualize
    a a game tree.

<h2>What is a game tree?</h2>

<p>In game theory, a game tree is a directed graph whose nodes are positions in a game and whose edges are moves.</p>
