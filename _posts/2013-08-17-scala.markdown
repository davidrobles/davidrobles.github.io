Although I've played around with Scala for the few months, these efforts largely involved simple
scripts and casual reading. It wasn't until last month that the opportunity to use Scala in a large
scale project finally arose and I dove right in. The project was a typical REST based web service
built on top of Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk, SimpleDB, S3 and Redis.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Person
    def initialize(name, age)
        @name = name
        @age = age
    end

    def to_s
        "My name is #{@name} and my age is #{@age}"
    end
end
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
